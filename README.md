# EC 320, Winter 2020

Welcome to the course GitHub page for **EC 320: Introduction to Econometrics** (Winter 2020) at the University of Oregon! This course introduces the statistical techniques that help economists learn about the world using data. We will focus much of our attention on regression analysis, the workhorse of applied econometrics. Using calculus and introductory statistics, we will cultivate a working understanding of the theory underpinning regression analysis. We will apply the insights of theory to work with and learn from actual data using R, a statistical programming language.

This repository contains the updated lecture slides I use in the course. The .html versions of the lecture slides allow you to view animations and interactive features, provided that you have an internet connection. The .pdf slides don't require an internet connection, but they cannot render the animations or interactive features. The slides are heavily borrowed (with permission) from Kyle Raze, who taught the course last quarter. You can access his depository [here](https://github.com/kyleraze/Intro_Econometrics_F19).  
For the problem sets and other materials, see Canvas.
