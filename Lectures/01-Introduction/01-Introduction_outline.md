## Tips for success

On Ipad

1. Show up
2. Notetaking advice
    
    - Your notes should interpret/translate the lecture, not copy it (I'll post slides and written examples)
    - Handwrite your notes
    
3. Reading advice

    - Read before class
    - Doing the reading isn't the same as reading (better to comprehend 1 section than stare blankly at a chapter for 3 hours)
    - Note what you don't understand (be specific)
    
4. Take problem sets seriously

    - Main form of practice
    - Slow down, read, and respond to directions (I write a lot)
    - Start early
    - Useful exam prep
    - More importantly, this is where you develop marketable skills
    
5. You can bring a 3-by-5-inch notecard for the exam

    - Write your own notecard 
    - The advantage of the notecard is studying
    - Not really a useful crutch
    
6. Ask questions

    - Chances are, someone else has the same question
    - Slows me down, *in a good way*
    
## Talk about the strike

- Situation: GEs and UO are negotiating over a new contract. UO is proposing significant cuts to healthcare.
- The GTFF has declared impasse, which raises the likelihood of a strike.
- How would a strike affect the class? Depends.
    
    - Upshot: Take the first midterm seriuosly (could be the last assessment)!

- If you have questions, ask me.
